Data and simulation codes for plotting the Edge-length Abundance distributions in Fig. 5. 
The reps folder contains repititions for each set of parameters.
The sigma used are sigmas = [0, 1, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0]
Each file is named by the index in this list, eg "EAD_average_sigma_2.csv" saves the simulation for sigma=1.5
